        <h3>Why you should hire a farmer</h3>
        <p>
          Debugging code is a lot like debugging plants - specifically, removing
          hornworms from tomato plants. First you have to test the code. This is
          like walking into a field of tomatoes, hoping that there is no damage,
          but knowing that Murphy's law exists. Then you have to find and
          correct the error: carefully check every leaf and line of code until
          you catch the suspect red-handed. In both fields, you never know if
          you have caught the last bug. I have developed an extremely detail
          oriented mindset because bugs tend to multiply, and I do not like
          creating larger problems for myself. Beyond searching for bugs, I am
          used to working long hours in physically and mentally uncomfortable
          conditions. Farming means being outside in all types of weather and
          solving an endless array of problems. While I anticipate your office
          will be air conditioned, being able to maintain focus and a good
          attitude when facing challenging and inconvenient situations is a
          critical skill to form desirable solutions. I am determined, scrappy,
          have a solid foundation in software development, and am excited to
          jump into your role.
